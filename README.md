# attendance-tracker

Plan:
Use arduino/raspberry pi with two ultrasonic sensors to determine if someone is entering or exiting doorway. Device then makes request to RESTful API, which communicates with a mongodb instance. Will then be able to read certain data, such as: current occupancy, number of entries/exits in a time period, max/min occupancy in a day, etc.
